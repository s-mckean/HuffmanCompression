# Huffman Compression


A program that takes a text file input and implements Huffman encoding on it.
Using the letters' encoding it will compress the file into another text file, __compressed.txt.
The program will then decompress __compressed.txt to __decompressed.txt. 
__decompressed.txt will be identical to the text file that the user input.

Note: Behavior becomes unpredictable when using non-ASCII character file encoding.

Encluded are some sample files: data1.txt, data2.txt, data3.txt, data4.txt, data5.txt
